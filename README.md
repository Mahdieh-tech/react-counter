📝 Project Summary – React Counter

This repository is a practice React project that demonstrates how to manage state with React Hooks and build a simple, interactive UI.

⚙️ Key Features

State Management with Hooks: Uses useState to store and update the counter value.

Interactive Buttons: Three buttons—Increment, Decrement, and Reset—each with onClick handlers.

Responsive & Modern UI: Gradient backgrounds, glassmorphism effects, hover and active animations.

Clean Component Structure: A single functional component (Counter.js) and a dedicated stylesheet (Counter.css).

🛠 Implementation Details

Increment / Decrement functions adjust the count by +1 or –1.

Reset sets the count back to 0.

CSS applies gradients, rounded corners, shadows, and smooth transitions for a polished look.

All styling lives in Counter.css, keeping the component itself clean and focused on logic.

🎯 Purpose

This project was created as a practice exercise to strengthen React skills—particularly hooks, event handling, and styling components. It can serve as a template or learning resource for beginners experimenting with React.
